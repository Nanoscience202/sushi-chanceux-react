# Disclaimer:
This is a fun personal project made with React, Typescript and Tailwind. Other librairies used are react-router-dom, react-spring, and emailjs. This app is not meant for any commercial use, since it is just an app that I made while learning React. Images used belong to their rightful owners and no money is made from this.

# Features:
* A cool home page with a beautiful menu section.
* A contact us page (the only one you can reach out is me).
* An about us page with some cool animations
* An order page where you can see what you have ordered and place an order (will not order anything in reality)
